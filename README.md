# Volume-control-using-hand-gestures

ðŸ”Š Hand Gesture Volume Controller
Control your system volume using hand gestures with the help of OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Pycaw! This real-time computer vision project uses your webcam to track hand landmarks and adjusts volume based on the distance between your thumb and index finger.

# ðŸ“¸ How It Works:

The webcam captures your hand in real-time.

The program detects landmarks using MediaPipe.

It calculates the distance between the thumb tip and index finger tip.

This distance is mapped to system volume range.

Volume changes dynamically as you pinch/open your fingers.
